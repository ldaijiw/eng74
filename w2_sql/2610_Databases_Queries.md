## Databases

**What is a Database?**
A location to gather information. A structured set of data held in a computer.

We must be able to structure tables to contain the right type of info, so that we can query it.

**DBMS** - Database Management System, allows a computer to perform DB functions of storing, retrieving, adding, deleting, and modifying data.

Relational Databases contain connected data, tables should be related.

Types of DB
- Flat-file: Stores everything in one table, good for small numbers of records related to a single topic
- Relational DB: Gives ability to separate masses of data into numerous tables, linked to each other through use of keys.
- Big Data: Used for IoT

Relationship Types
- One to One: Each row in table A linked to no more than one row in table B, this is an attribute of relationship not tables
- One to Many: Each row in table can be related to many rows in relating table, allows frequentyl used info to be saved only once and referenced many times in all other tables.
- Many to Many: One or more rows in a table can be related to 0, 1, or many rows in another table. 3rd table called a mapping or link table required in order to implement such a relationship, e.g. customers can purchase many products.

Relationships can be shown with a **E**ntity **R**elationship **D**iagram

**Primary Key**
- Uniquely identifies each record in the table
- Most tables should have a primary key
- Each table can have more than one column which is part of its primary key (composite key) e.g. order no. + order line no.
- Either an attribute that is unique (e.g. NI number) or generated by DBMS
- DBMS will enforce uniqueness of primary key, not allowing repeated records to exist in the table
- Must be unique, cannot be null/blank, value must never change, and each table can only have one primary key column

**Foreign Key**: Primary key that exists in a separate table, builds relationship to primary table.


### Designing A Database

DB Tools
- Access: Microsoft product for DB

### Creating a DB

```
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
```

Then use to create table
```
USE db_name;
CREATE TABLE table_name(
	col1 VARCHAR(10),
	col2 VARCHAR(6),
)
```
- VARCHAR(N): Datatype,  Variable Character, each entry can have max N characters
