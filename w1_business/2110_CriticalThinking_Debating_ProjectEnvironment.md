## Critical Thinking

Helps to create strong arguments by justifying claims with evidence. Can contribute to any role as it requires ability to gather information, analyse and evaluate it.

**TRYING TO GET TO THE TRUTH, NOT JUST BE RIGHT**

Critical Thinking Skills:
- Actively seeking out all sides of an argument
- Checking facts and evidence
- Responding objectively

Benjamin Bloom Taxonomy (Thinking Triangle)

Evaluate, Synthesise (Combining information into something new), Analyse, Apply, Understand, Remember

3 Steps for critical thinking
- **Identify**: Main points of argument, claims being made, evidence used, conclusions reached
- **Analyse**: Does info make sense in relation to other research? How old is material, is it clear or is additional info needed? Does the argument present a balanced view or are some topics disregarded?
- **Apply**, look out for: Implications of other info, weaknesses when applied to a real-life situation, lack of coverage

3 Modes of thinking
- **Divergent**: Imagination, questions lead to ideas
- **Convergent**: Logic, facts lead to answers
- **Lateral**: Combination of the two, essential to make a proposal (ideas are nothing without evidence to back it up)

Incorrect Atttitudes
- Ignorant certainty: Belief that there are definite answers to all questions
- Naive relativism: Belief that there is no truth and all arguments are equal

**Enquiry-Based Learning**: Asking open questions to gather information rather than asking closed questions that are based on incomplete assumptions (e.g. what colour is the car vs. is the car red)

Enquiry Cycle
- Enquire, Investigate, Create, Discuss, Reflect

What kind of questions might we ask when thinking critically?
- What are the sources of evidence?
- What are the kind of claims being made?
- Where is the evidence for these claims?
- What are the strengths/weaknesses?
- How clear are the points?
- Is it a balanced argument?
- Are there underlying themes?
- Do we understand the background?
- Are the examples good?
- Are the examples real or imagined?


## Debating

Argument Structure
- Claim: present your argument in a clear statement
- Evidence: present evidence to support your claim
- Impact: explain the significance of the evidence (how does it support your claim)

Coherence
- Do the claims make logical sense
- Are the claims based on opinion or supported with evidence
- Are any assumptions made
- Have all alternatives been considered

Supporting Evidence
- Does the evidence support all claims made?
- Is evidence relevant?

Debating Etiquette
- Acknowledge other person's view before challenging it
- Be constructive rather than simply dismissing the other person's point of view
- Reflect on the strengths of the other person's argument
- Think about your language and whether you risk being offensive before you speak


Logical Fallacies to Look for
- False dichotomy: Where the speaker forces the debate into two sides, though there are more options available
- Assertion: When the speaker presents a statement as fact which appears invalid or may be an assumption
- Morally flawed: arguments which go aginst the code of ethics and morals
- Correlation rather than causation: When a speaker links two
- Failure to deliver promises: Speaker might fail to complete a task they promised to deliver, such as evidence they promised to provide
- Straw man: Speaker may intentionally introduce an argument against them
- Contradiction: Speaker's argument may contradict their previous argument and reduce their credibility
- Compare conclusion to reality: Consider what would happen if the motion became reality, which usually reveals that it's more complicated and problematic than the speaker suggested


Art of Persuasion

Three Pillars of Rhetoric
- Ethos: Appealing through authority or credibility
- Pathos: Appealing through emotional empathy
- Logos: Appealing through logic and reasoning

Important Skills for Debating
- Keep points relevant
- Provide evidence
- Remain objective
- Consider audience's attention span
- Use notes but keep them brief and well organised

Do
- Be prepared
- Stay calm
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Keep your language simple
- Active listening

Don't
- Falsify or alter evidence
- Publicly disagree with the decision
- Attack a speaker rather than the motion
- Act aggressively or offensively
- Interrupt others
- Disagree with facts or obvious truths

It's ok to make mistakes and agree. Don't raise your voice, improve your argument


## Project Environment

BAU is the normal execution of standard operations within an organisation

A project is unique and transient with a desired outcome.

Project lifecycle
- Initiation
- Planning
- Executing
- Monitoring and Controlling
- Closing

Triple Constraint
- Time
- Cost
- Quality

Finding the balance between the three can be difficult. Will have to compromise.
