Topics covered
- Trello agile boards
- Git and GitHub
- SSH keys, initialising repositories, and committing/pushing code

## Time and Task Management

- Tools and techniques used to accomplish specific tasks, projects, and goals.
- Essential for completing work
- Crucial to prove your worth, skills are useless if you can't manage your time
- Task management: Process of managing a task during it's lifecycle, planning, tracking, and reporting.
- Consider both the importance and time sensitivity of a task

#### Pareto Principle

**80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes**
Reminder that the relationship between input and output is not equal.  
For example for a financial advisor: 80% of the revenue should come from the top 20 clients. Therefore it's important to think about where to focus your efforts to maximise this relationship. e.g. the advisor should focus their efforts on improving and maintaining their relationships with the top 20 clients.

#### Eisenhower Model

Two types of activities:

- **Urgent**: Demand immediate attention, usually associated with achieving someone else's goals. Consequences of not dealing with them are immediate.
- **Important**: Outcome that lead us to achieving our goals, proffesional and personal.

Can consider 4 types:

- Important and Urgent: Things that you could not foresee, things you left until last minute
- Important but not Urgent: Personal and professional goals, leave plenty of time to do them properly so they don't become urgent
- Not Important but Urgent: Prevent you from achieving your goals, ask yourself whether you can reschedule or delegate them
- Not Important and Not Urgent: Just a distraction, avoid if possible

**2 MINUTE RULE: If it can be completed in 2 minutes it's worth doing**

##Communication

Delivery always affects the message - how you say it is more important than the content.  
**THE REAL MESSAGE IS THE ONE RECEIVED NOT THE ONE INTENDED**

Cognitive biases - assumptions that we make that can be detrimental

- Bandwagon bias: Someone joins a task just because everyone else is doing it
- Confirmation bias
- Anchoring: Remembering the first or most noticeable event instead of looking at everything evenly


Hats 6 colours
- White: Represents facts, information, and statistical data, as well as identifying missing information and from which sources it may be collected.
- Red: Symbolizes emotions and feelings
- Yellow: Signifies positive rationality, and is used to look at the positive aspects of a situation or idea, on the potential benefits of the suggested course of action
- Black: Used to discuss the negative repercussions of the plans, the potential dangers.
- Green: Creativity and unconventional thinking
- Blue: Making decisions, directing the discussion, and summarising the major points of the discussion

Exploiting bias in the work place
- Reactance: By telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes
- Reciprocity: Be the first to give feeling of obligation to give when you receive personalised and unexpected makes it even better.
- Door in the face: Forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request
- Likeability: Give compliments and build cooperation
- Social proof: People look to others to determine their own actions


Conflict resolution:
- Before giving feedback, think about why do you want to give feedback, what are you trying to achieve 
- Take time to understand the situation, know your audience, ask others for their perspective, compromise.

### 21/10/2020

Topics covered:
- Critical thinking
- Debating
- Product environment
- GDPR

## Critical Thinking

Helps to create strong arguments by justifying claims with evidence. Can contribute to any role as it requires ability to gather information, analyse and evaluate it.

**TRYING TO GET TO THE TRUTH, NOT JUST BE RIGHT**

Critical Thinking Skills:
- Actively seeking out all sides of an argument
- Checking facts and evidence
- Responding objectively

Benjamin Bloom Taxonomy (Thinking Triangle)

Evaluate, Synthesise (Combining information into something new), Analyse, Apply, Understand, Remember

3 Steps for critical thinking
- **Identify**: Main points of argument, claims being made, evidence used, conclusions reached
- **Analyse**: Does info make sense in relation to other research? How old is material, is it clear or is additional info needed? Does the argument present a balanced view or are some topics disregarded?
- **Apply**, look out for: Implications of other info, weaknesses when applied to a real-life situation, lack of coverage

3 Modes of thinking
- **Divergent**: Imagination, questions lead to ideas
- **Convergent**: Logic, facts lead to answers
- **Lateral**: Combination of the two, essential to make a proposal (ideas are nothing without evidence to back it up)

Incorrect Atttitudes
- Ignorant certainty: Belief that there are definite answers to all questions
- Naive relativism: Belief that there is no truth and all arguments are equal

**Enquiry-Based Learning**: Asking open questions to gather information rather than asking closed questions that are based on incomplete assumptions (e.g. what colour is the car vs. is the car red)

Enquiry Cycle
- Enquire, Investigate, Create, Discuss, Reflect

What kind of questions might we ask when thinking critically?
- What are the sources of evidence?
- What are the kind of claims being made?
- Where is the evidence for these claims?
- What are the strengths/weaknesses?
- How clear are the points?
- Is it a balanced argument?
- Are there underlying themes?
- Do we understand the background?
- Are the examples good?
- Are the examples real or imagined?
 

## Debating

Argument Structure
- Claim: present your argument in a clear statement
- Evidence: present evidence to support your claim
- Impact: explain the significance of the evidence (how does it support your claim)

Coherence
- Do the claims make logical sense
- Are the claims based on opinion or supported with evidence
- Are any assumptions made
- Have all alternatives been considered

Supporting Evidence
- Does the evidence support all claims made?
- Is evidence relevant?

Debating Etiquette
- Acknowledge other person's view before challenging it
- Be constructive rather than simply dismissing the other person's point of view
- Reflect on the strengths of the other person's argument
- Think about your language and whether you risk being offensive before you speak


Logical Fallacies to Look for
- False dichotomy: Where the speaker forces the debate into two sides, though there are more options available
- Assertion: When the speaker presents a statement as fact which appears invalid or may be an assumption
- Morally flawed: arguments which go aginst the code of ethics and morals
- Correlation rather than causation: When a speaker links two 
- Failure to deliver promises: Speaker might fail to complete a task they promised to deliver, such as evidence they promised to provide
- Straw man: Speaker may intentionally introduce an argument against them 
- Contradiction: Speaker's argument may contradict their previous argument and reduce their credibility 
- Compare conclusion to reality: Consider what would happen if the motion became reality, which usually reveals that it's more complicated and problematic than the speaker suggested


Art of Persuasion

Three Pillars of Rhetoric
- Ethos: Appealing through authority or credibility
- Pathos: Appealing through emotional empathy
- Logos: Appealing through logic and reasoning

Important Skills for Debating
- Keep points relevant
- Provide evidence
- Remain objective
- Consider audience's attention span
- Use notes but keep them brief and well organised

Do
- Be prepared
- Stay calm
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Keep your language simple
- Active listening

Don't
- Falsify or alter evidence
- Publicly disagree with the decision
- Attack a speaker rather than the motion
- Act aggressively or offensively
- Interrupt others
- Disagree with facts or obvious truths

It's ok to make mistakes and agree. Don't raise your voice, improve your argument


## Project Environment 

BAU is the normal execution of standard operations within an organisation

A project is unique and transient with a desired outcome.

Project lifecycle
- Initiation
- Planning
- Executing
- Monitoring and Controlling
- Closing

Triple Constraint
- Time
- Cost
- Quality

Finding the balance between the three can be difficult. Will have to compromise.
