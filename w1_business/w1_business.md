#### Pareto Principle

**80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes**
Reminder that the relationship between input and output is not equal.  
For example for a financial advisor: 80% of the revenue should come from the top 20 clients. Therefore it's important to think about where to focus your efforts to maximise this relationship. e.g. the advisor should focus their efforts on improving and maintaining their relationships with the top 20 clients.

#### Eisenhower Principle

Two types of activities:

- **Urgent**: Demand immediate attention, usually associated with achieving someone else's goals. Consequences of not dealing with them are immediate.
- **Important**: Outcome that lead us to achieving our goals, proffesional and personal.

Can consider 4 types:

- Important and Urgent: Things that you could not foresee, things you left until last minute
- Important but not Urgent: Personal and professional goals, leave plenty of time to do them properly so they don't become urgent
- Not Important but Urgent: Prevent you from achieving your goals, ask yourself whether you can reschedule or delegate them
- Not Important and Not Urgent: Just a distraction, avoid if possible
