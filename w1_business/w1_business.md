## Time and Task Management

- Tools and techniques used to accomplish specific tasks, projects, and goals.
- Essential for completing work
- Crucial to prove your worth, skills are useless if you can't manage your time
- Task management: Process of managing a task during it's lifecycle, planning, tracking, and reporting.
- Consider both the importance and time sensitivity of a task

#### Pareto Principle

**80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes**
Reminder that the relationship between input and output is not equal.  
For example for a financial advisor: 80% of the revenue should come from the top 20 clients. Therefore it's important to think about where to focus your efforts to maximise this relationship. e.g. the advisor should focus their efforts on improving and maintaining their relationships with the top 20 clients.

#### Eisenhower Model

Two types of activities:

- **Urgent**: Demand immediate attention, usually associated with achieving someone else's goals. Consequences of not dealing with them are immediate.
- **Important**: Outcome that lead us to achieving our goals, proffesional and personal.

Can consider 4 types:

- Important and Urgent: Things that you could not foresee, things you left until last minute
- Important but not Urgent: Personal and professional goals, leave plenty of time to do them properly so they don't become urgent
- Not Important but Urgent: Prevent you from achieving your goals, ask yourself whether you can reschedule or delegate them
- Not Important and Not Urgent: Just a distraction, avoid if possible

**2 MINUTE RULE: If it can be completed in 2 minutes it's worth doing**

##Communication

Delivery always affects the message - how you say it is more important than the content.  
**THE REAL MESSAGE IS THE ONE RECEIVED NOT THE ONE INTENDED**

Cognitive biases - assumptions that we make that can be detrimental

- Bandwagon bias: Someone joins a task just because everyone else is doing it
- Confirmation bias
- Anchoring: Remembering the first or most noticeable event instead of looking at everything evenly


Hats 6 colours
- White: Represents facts, information, and statistical data, as well as identifying missing information and from which sources it may be collected.
- Red: Symbolizes emotions and feelings
- Yellow: Signifies positive rationality, and is used to look at the positive aspects of a situation or idea, on the potential benefits of the suggested course of action
- Black: Used to discuss the negative repercussions of the plans, the potential dangers.
- Green: Creativity and unconventional thinking
- Blue: Making decisions, directing the discussion, and summarising the major points of the discussion

Exploiting bias in the work place
- Reactance: By telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes
- Reciprocity: Be the first to give feeling of obligation to give when you receive personalised and unexpected makes it even better.
- Door in the face: Forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request
- Likeability: Give compliments and build cooperation
- Social proof: People look to others to determine their own actions


Conflict resolution:
- Before giving feedback, think about why do you want to give feedback, what are you trying to achieve 
- Take time to understand the situation, know your audience, ask others for their perspective, compromise.
