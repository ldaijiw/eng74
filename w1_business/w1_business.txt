Time and task management
	Tools and techniques used to accomplish specific tasks, projects, and goals
	Essential for completing work
	Crucial to prove your worth, skills are useless if you can't manage your time
	 
Task management
	Process of managing a task during it's lifecycle
	planning, tracking, and reporting.


Consider the importance and time sensitivity of a task

Pareto Principle -
80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes
Reminder that the relationship between input and output is not equal

For example for for a financial advisor: 80% of the revenue should come from the top 20 clients
Therefore importnant to think about where to focus your efforts to maximise this relationship. e.g the advisor should focus their efforts on improving and maintaining their relationships with the top 20 clients




Eisenhower Principle -
Two types of activities
	Urgent - Demand immediate attention, usually associated with achieving someone else's goals
		consequences of not dealing with them are immediate

	Important - Outcome that lead us to achieving our goals, professional/personal

Important and Urgent - things that you could not foresee, things you left until last minute
Important but not Urgent - Personal and professional goals, leave plenty of time to do them properly so they don't become urgent
Not important but urgent -  Prevent you from achieving your goals, ask yourself whether you can reschedule or delegate them
Not important and not urgent - Just a distraction, avoid if possible



	Prioritise well
	Set time-boundaries
	organise routinely
	plan ahead
	focus

2MINUTE RULE JUDGE IF IT CAN COMPLETED IN 2 MINUTES


COMMUNICATION

Delivery always affects the message - how you say it is more important than the content
THE REAL MESSAGE IS THE ONE RECEIVED NOT THE ONE INTENDED

cognitive biases - assumptions that we make that can be detrimental

	anchoring - remembering the first or most noticeable event instead of looking at everything evenly
	confirmation bias


exploiting bias in the workplace
REACTANCE - by telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes
RECIPROCITY - be the first to give
	feeling of obligation to give when you receive
	personalised and unexpected makes it even better
DOOR IN THE FACE - Forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request
LIKEABILITY - give compliments and build cooperation
SOCIAL PROOF - People look to others to determine their own actions

DIFFERENT COLOUR HATS
white, yellow, black, red, green, blue

before giving feedback - think about why do you want to give feedback, what are you trying to achieve
take time to understand the situation, know your audience, ask others for their perspective, compromise
